1. **Identify** all visible food items.
2. **Estimate** portion size for each item (grams, cups, slices...).
3. **Classify** meal timing (breakfast, post-workout, etc.) â€” based on content or context.
4. **Calculate** nutritional values:
   - Calories
   - Macronutrients: carbs (incl. sugar), protein, fat
   - Fiber
   - Micronutrients (key for recovery or performance)

Return **ONLY** the analysis in JSON format as:
